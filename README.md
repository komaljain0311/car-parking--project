# 🚘 Smart Parking Detector (High Accuracy)

This project uses **YOLOv8** object detection to monitor and analyze the occupancy of parking slots in real-time. With the help of a user-friendly Streamlit interface, it provides a powerful tool for smart parking management using both predefined and custom videos.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 High-accuracy vehicle detection using YOLOv8.
- 📊 Real-time vacant and occupied parking slot statistics.
- 📹 Works with built-in videos or custom uploaded videos.
- ✍️ Interactive tool to **draw, modify, and save** parking slots.
- 💾 Automatically saves slots for each video.
- 🧱 Modular code using OpenCV and NumPy.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- NumPy

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python-headless ultralytics numpy
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Mark Parking Slots

Run the following script to draw parking slot polygons on a video frame:

```bash
python mark_slots.py
```

- Use **left-click** to draw or drag points.
- **Right-click** to delete the last slot.
- Press **`s`** to save, **`q`** to quit without saving.
- Press **`c`** to copy the last drawn slot.

Saved slot coordinates will be stored in `parking_slots/` as `.npy` files.

### Step 2: Start the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Choose a predefined video or upload your own.
- The app will use the corresponding saved slots or ask you to draw them if not found.
- Live status of total, vacant, and occupied slots will be displayed side-by-side with the video.

## 📦 Model Weights

Ensure the YOLOv8 weights file (`yolov8m.pt`) is in the working directory. It should automatically download when the model is loaded, but if there’s a connection issue, you can manually download it from:
[https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/)



## 📷 Sample Videos(make  sure all videos are in 1 folder )

Make sure sample videos (`easy1.mp4`, `easy2.mp4`, etc.) are placed in the `videos/` directory. You can add more videos and draw slot files for each.
